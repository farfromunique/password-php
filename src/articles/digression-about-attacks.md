## A Digression About Attacks ##
There are a few ways that one can gain access to an account that is not theirs:
* Targeted attack
* Brute-force attack
* Back door
* Data breach

A **targeted attack** is one that targets a specific user. This is similar to the classic TV hacker. They are after someone specific, and don’t care about the rest of the accounts on the system. These attacks are generally uncommon, but they’re the ones foiled by a hard-to-guess password.

A **brute-Force attack** can target one or many accounts. These used to be more common, but more sophisticated methods have emerged that have significantly reduced the frequency of these. Attacks of this sort are foiled by account lock-outs (if you enter the wrong password 5 times, you have to reset your password).

**Back doors** are not, strictly speaking, in the same category of attack. They don’t gain access to data using the typical methods, and so they aren’t impacted by the normal methods a user may have of improving security. They are, to put it simply, not the user’s problem. But if I didn’t at least mention them, I know there would be questions.

**Data breaches** are strange, because they may or may not be impacted by things that the user does. Whether they are or are not depends on the setup of the system being attacked. While articles can be (and many have been) written about back end security and how to make sure that a data breach reveals as little data as possible, this is not that article. [This article](/discussion-of-passwords) is talking about what a user can do to improve their odds of their data not being revealed.

The *sad truth* is that, if an attacker is dedicated enough, there is practically nothing that can be done by a user to prevent them from gaining access to unauthorized data. All users can do is make it harder. That's what [Password.acwpd.com](http://password.acwpd.com) aims to do.
