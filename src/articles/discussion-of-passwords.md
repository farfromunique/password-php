For years, we’ve been told, "Your password should be hard to guess! Make sure that you include non-word characters!". I’ve had to come up with passwords that met the following criteria (note that no systems have asked for all of these; as some are contradictory):
> Use a capital letter; use a lower-case letter; use a number; use a symbol;  

> Don't use “!”; don't use “@”; don't use any special symbol;  

> Don't include more than 3 consecutive letters; don't include more than 2 consecutive numbers;  

> Don't use more than 5 letters of your (first name / last name / email address / username);  

> Avoid using more than 4 letters from any dictionary word; never use a dictionary word;  

> Must not be one of the last (2 / 3 / 4 / 5) passwords you have used; must not be a password you have ever used before; the first 5 characters must not match a password that you have ever used before;  

> Must be 6 characters or longer; must be 8 characters or longer; must be exactly 8 characters; must not be longer than 12 characters;  

*Oh, and it shouldn’t be something that can be guessed.*

Passwords are supposed to keep your data (settings, posts, pictures, whatever) private. They do this by proving your identity; presumably, nobody but you will know your password. That’s why it’s important not to have a guessable password; we’ve all seen a movie or TV show where the hacker sits down at a computer, looks around at the victim’s desk, and can guess the password in 3 tries.  
> Ha! He has a picture of his wife and child on his desk! Let’s try the wife’s name… no, anniversary… no, child’s middle name and date of birth… I’m in!

So, obviously, a password that can be guessed is a bad idea. The problem is that humans are good at guessing the same types of things that we remember – words, names, dates, etc. This is where some of the rules above come from: no dictionary words, don’t include your name, email address, and so on.

However, this leaves the average person using a password like `1p@Ssw0rd4all` (which meets the most common criteria), and then using it for EVERYTHING. This is hardly ideal, but it’s better than using `WadeWilson616!` for everything.  
So far, I’ve probably not said anything that’s surprising. These are things that cyber-security experts tell us on the news every time someone popular gets hacked. 

## So, what are we supposed to do?

Lots of people have started using password managers, so they don’t need to remember all of their passwords. That’s a good thing: it means that they can generate a random, garbage string (`jPE?YX_)PUkGnW5`) *for each individual website that they have to log in to*. This makes many people feel more secure, but it may be a false security.

Assuming that a user wants to be as secure as possible, the following are currently suggested:

* Use a random password. The following factors all make for a better password:  
  * Longer maximum length (not necessarily longer actual length, although that’s good too!)  
  * More possible characters (upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, special characters, white space)  
  * Fewer sequential characters (numbers, letters, etc.)  
  * Not following a pattern (first letter capitalized, last character an exclamation mark, etc.)  
  * Use a different password for each site that needs one.  
* Use a long password  
* Use as many different character types as possible  
* Use two-factor authentication  

In the end, we are all faced with a trade-off between security and convenience: using `1p@Ssw0rd4all` will satisfy most sites’ requirements, even though it isn’t very secure. However, it’s super convenient.  
On the other end of the spectrum, having to enter `95/=_^i(L%sIoeJCPg]$wFQ-T&8l7R6u=:TVC_#gdNrl,H&]f` AND answer a prompt on your phone makes it very difficult for anyone (including you) to access your account… but it’s not very convenient.
